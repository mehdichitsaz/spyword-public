<h1>SpyWord Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-02-24</p>
<p>SpyWord is a local pass-and-play word game. We designed it to work on your device without requiring an account.</p>

<h2>1) Data We Collect</h2>
<p>By default, SpyWord does not collect personal data from you.</p>
<ul>
  <li>No account is required.</li>
  <li>No name, email, phone number, or precise location is requested by the app.</li>
  <li>Gameplay runs locally on your device.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to contact us by email, we will receive the information you include in your message.</p>

<h2>2) How Data Is Used</h2>
<p>Because SpyWord does not collect personal data by default, there is no personal data used for gameplay.</p>
<p>If you contact us, we use your email only to respond to your question or request and support the app.</p>

<h2>3) Third-Party Services/SDKs</h2>
<p>SpyWord currently does not use third-party SDKs for login, cloud storage, analytics, or advertising in the gameplay app experience.</p>
<p>If this changes in a future release, we will update this policy before or at the time those services are introduced.</p>

<h2>4) Ads and Analytics</h2>
<p><strong>Current status:</strong> SpyWord does not show third-party ads and does not use third-party analytics SDKs at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Future possibility:</strong> We may add ads or analytics in future versions to support and improve the app. If we do, this policy will be updated to explain what is added, what data may be processed, and your available choices.</p>

<h2>5) Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>SpyWord is a general-audience party game. Since we do not collect personal data by default, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
<p>If you believe a child has provided personal information to us through email contact, please contact us so we can review and delete it when appropriate.</p>

<h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
<p>Gameplay data is local to your device as part of normal app operation.</p>
<p>We do not maintain a server backend for gameplay and do not store personal gameplay data on our servers.</p>
<p>If you email us, we may keep that correspondence for as long as needed to respond, resolve support issues, and meet legal obligations.</p>

<h2>7) Your Rights / Contact</h2>
<p>If you have privacy questions or requests, contact us at: <strong>chitsaz.mehdi77@gmail.com</strong></p>
<p>You may request access, correction, or deletion of personal information you provided directly by email, subject to applicable law.</p>

<h2>8) Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will post the updated version on this page and revise the "Last updated" date above.</p>
